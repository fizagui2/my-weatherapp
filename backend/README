## Backend Folder
- The backend folder contains the Python backend code for this project. This backend serves as the core logic for handling requests, processing data, and interfacing 
- with external APIs to provide the required functionality to the front-end.


## Examples of usage
- A request to the /weather route with a city name fetches current weather data for the specified location.
- The backend processes and returns JSON-formatted weather data, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and condition descriptions.
- Error handling ensures meaningful error messages are returned in case of API failure or invalid requests.




Ensure the backend.py file is maintained and updated as needed for compatibility with the front-end. Replace the API key or modify the API URL in the code if 
external services require reconfiguration. Verify the backend is running on the correct port specified in the front-end configuration.
